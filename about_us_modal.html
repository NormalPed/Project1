          <p>You insult me in my home, you're forgiven this time. Things go well,
          your eyes dilate, you shake and I'm high. Look in my eyes deep and
          watch the clouds change with time. 20 hours won't print my picture
          milk carton size.</p> <p>Call me up congratulations ain't the real why.
          There's no pressures besides brilliance, let's say by day nine.
          Corporate ignorance lets me control time. By the way, by the way...</p>
